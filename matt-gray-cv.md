    In my time on the API team, I transitioned the API from a monolithic

    gateway to perform authentication, access control and other shared
    functionality. I moved our request logging from SQL server to a new system
    based on Redis, Logstash and Elasticsearch. I helped with the our migration
    to a new CDN provider. I spent 3 months working with the infrastructure team
    automating and testing our Nginx and HAProxy external loadbalancer
    deployment.
